## Widgets
Almost every element of your Flutter app is a widget. Widgets are designed to be immutable, since using immutable widgets helps keep the app UI lightweight.

There are two fundamental types of widgets you will use:

Stateless: widgets that depend only upon their own configuration info, such as a static image in an image view.
Stateful: widgets that need to maintain dynamic information and do so by interacting with a State object.
