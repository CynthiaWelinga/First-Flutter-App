A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Dart
Flutter apps are written using the Dart programming language
Dart allows for a reactive and declarative style of programming by using Ahead-Of-Time or AOT compilation.

Dart can also use Just-In-Time or JIT compilation. It improves the development workflow by allowing a hot reload capability to refresh the UI during development without the need for an entirely new build.

## Widgets
Almost every element of your Flutter app is a widget. Widgets are designed to be immutable, since using immutable widgets helps keep the app UI lightweight.

There are two fundamental types of widgets you will use:

- Stateless: widgets that depend only upon their own configuration info, such as a static image in an image view.
- Stateful: widgets that need to maintain dynamic information and do so by interacting with a State object.
